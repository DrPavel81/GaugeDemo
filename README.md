## Gauge Demo

The repository contains sample test application for site automationpractice.com.

### Specifications

* This demo includes a sample specification which opens up a browser and showcases two spec examples.

### Writing the implementations

This is where the java implementation of the steps would be implemented. Since this is a Selenium based project, the java implementation would invoke Selenium APIs as required.

- Note that every Gauge step implementation is annotated with a `Step` attribute that takes the Step text pattern as a parameter.
